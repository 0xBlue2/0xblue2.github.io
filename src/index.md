# About the Website

Hi! This is where I'll put my writeups of the challenges from the [Web Security Academy by Portswigger](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dashboard). It's a work in progress, but I'm updating it regularly.

## Where's the name come from?
The name(and general format) is ripped straight from one of the greatest ctf courses, [Nightmare](https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/).

## What does it cover?
I'll likely update this as I update this blog, but currently I plan to include:
- A writeup(explanation) of each lab in the beginner-level "Server-side vulnerabilities" course
- and a code sample to run a similar version of the vulnerable website locally
