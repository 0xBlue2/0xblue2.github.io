# Module 1

- Read the syllabus
- Install the required software (Packet Tracer, VirtualBox, and Windows/Linux guest VMs)

## Vocabulary
Host operating system
 : pretty much synonymous with "your actual computer"

Guest operating system
 : the operating system you're virtualizing (emulating, simulating, whatever). For this class, we're creating a Windows virtual machine (VM) and a Linux VM

Linux
 : A family of operating systems that share a bunch of common tools and have a filesystem somewhat different from Windows. There are a lot of options, but I would pick one with a lot of documentation/support, like Ubuntu. 


## Installing Packet Tracer 
To simplify grading, the professor uses one specific version of Packet Tracer (5.1). If you can't run Packet Tracer on your computer (you're running Mac), just install it on the guest Windows VM.

The professor makes a discussion post with the link to Packet Tracer 5.1. Just unzip and run the installer inside.

## Installing VirtualBox
VirtualBox is what we're going to use to run our virtualized versions of Windows and Linux. After downloading the right installer ([https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)),
